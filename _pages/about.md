Hi there 👋 I am Zhixuan Zhou, a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at [UNC Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/), supervised by [Guorong Wu](https://www.med.unc.edu/psych/people/guorong-wu-phd-2/) in [ACM Lab](https://www.acmlab.org/).
Previously, I completed my undergraduate study at the School of Computer Science and Engineer, South China University of Technology.

Research Interests
======
My research sits at the intersection of **computational neuroscience** and **machine learning**, with a focus on developing geometric and dynamical methods for learning on manifolds.

My core research revolves around combining **flow/diffusion/bridge methods** with **Riemannian geometry**, **stochastic optimal control** to study general manifolds. I am particularly interested in:

- **Generative models on manifolds**: Flow matching and score-based diffusion models with geometric constraints, like geodesic computation in learned latent spaces.
- **Computational neuroscience**: Trajectory inference across lifespan, and large-scale neuroimaging data analysis.
- **Geometric deep learning**: Leveraging Riemannian geometry and optimal control theory for structured data.
